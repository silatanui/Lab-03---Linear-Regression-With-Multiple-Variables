 Exercise 1: Linear regression with multiple variables

 Instructions
 ------------

 This file contains code that helps you get started on the
 linear regression exercise.

 You will need to complete the following functions in this
 exercise:

    warmUpExercise.m
    plotData.m
    gradientDescent.m
    computeCost.m
    gradientDescentMulti.m
    computeCostMulti.m
    featureNormalize.m
    normalEqn.m

 For this part of the exercise, you will need to change some
 parts of the code below for various experiments (e.g., changing
 learning rates).

"""
================ Part 2: Gradient Descent ================

====================== YOUR CODE HERE ======================
Instructions: We have provided you with the following starter
              code that runs gradient descent with a particular
              learning rate (alpha). 

              Your task is to first make sure that your functions - 
              computeCost and gradientDescent already work with 
              this starter code and support multiple variables.

              After that, try running gradient descent with 
              different values of alpha and see which one gives
              you the best result.

              Finally, you should complete the code at the end
              to predict the price of a 1650 sq-ft, 3 br house.

Hint: At prediction, make sure you do the same feature normalization.
