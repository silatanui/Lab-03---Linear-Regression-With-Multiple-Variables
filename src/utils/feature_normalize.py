# FEATURENORMALIZE Normalizes the features in X
#   FEATURENORMALIZE(X) returns a normalized version of X where
#   the mean value of each feature is 0 and the standard deviation
#   is 1. This is often a good preprocessing step to do when
#   working with learning algorithms.

def feature_normalize(X):
    # You need to set these values correctly
    n = X.shape[1]  # the number of features
    X_norm = X
    mu = np.zeros(n)
    sigma = np.zeros(n)
        
    # ====================== YOUR CODE HERE ======================
    # Instructions: First, for each feature dimension, compute the mean
    #               of the feature and subtract it from the dataset,
    #               storing the mean value in mu. Next, compute the 
    #               standard deviation of each feature and divide
    #               each feature by it's standard deviation, storing
    #               the standard deviation in sigma. 
    #
    #               Note that X is a matrix where each column is a 
    #               feature and each row is an example. You need 
    #               to perform the normalization separately for 
    #               each feature. 
    #
    # Hint: You might find the 'np.mean' and 'np.std' functions useful.
    #       np.std(X, 0, ddof=1) <==> std in Octave
    mu = np.mean(X, axis=0)
    sigma = np.std(X, axis=0)
    X_norm = (X - mu) / sigma

    return X_norm, mu, sigma
