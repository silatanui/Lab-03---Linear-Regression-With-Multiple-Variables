    # Instructions: Return the 5x5 identity matrix 
    #               In python, we return values by writing the "return" statement
    #               and the value/variable afterwards. The variable should be
    #               declared before returning it.

    # ===========================================
   # Using numpy eye
    A = np.eye(5)

    print(A)
    return A
